// An explicit proxy in the environment (HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY, ALL_PROXY and
// their lowercase forms, with NO_PROXY) wins, as it does for net/http. Without
// one, macOS asks CFNetwork, Windows asks WinHTTP's automatic proxy (PAC, WPAD
// and the static per-user settings), and Linux reads the environment only:
// desktops that keep their proxy in GSettings do not export it, and this
// package does not start a D-Bus or GIO session to find it.
//
// A macOS system whose policy is a PAC script returns
// ErrSystemProxyUnavailable: evaluating the script is asynchronous and needs a
// run loop, and silently going direct would bypass the user's policy.
//
// The call may block while the system evaluates its policy. It starts no
// goroutine and keeps nothing after it returns.
